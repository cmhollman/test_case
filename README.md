# USF Test Project 

**Author**: [Chris Hollman](mailto:chollman91@gmail.com)

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this project. Please let me know if you have any questions.

## Questions
-**What is the business objective you are looking to solve for? Specifically, what decisions are you going to inform?**
For the sake of simplicity, a quick look at performace vs. USF's main competitor. This will help identify divisions and segments where USF is being outperformed by their primary competition and inform where to focus sales efforts and/or increase presence.

-**Based on your exploration of the data, what insights do you have about our customers?**
Overall USF is outperforming primary competetion in every account category. The vast majority of weekly spending comes from Independent Restaurant ($6,845,534) and Hospitality ($1,265,565) accounts. USF accounts for 71.63% of reported weekly sales to Independent Restaurants and 77.22% of reported weekly sales to Hospitality accounts. The segment where USF perfmorms most poorly is among National Chains, where they account for 60.56% of weekly reported sales as compared to 22.65% for the primary competitor. 

-**Develop a visualization tool or output that can be used to support the business decisions. What recommendations can you make to the business?**
A Tableau dashboard summarizing this information is available [Here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/RND56DCXG?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Given the significant disparity in the competition's success among National Chains, a review should be done of why that is occurring and whether USF has the ability or desire to improve sales among these account types. In particular, the main competitor performs best in division code 14  

-**How would you partner with the broader analytics team (including data scientists) to enhance this analysis?**
It would be useful to look at historical sales data in these devisions and market segments to identify whether USF is losing market share to primary competition these specific areas.
